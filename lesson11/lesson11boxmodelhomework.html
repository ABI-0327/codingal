        Sigiriya was built by the fifth-century king Kashyapa I, who ruled the native Sinhalese dynasty, the Moriya. The imposing fortress was the capital of the Sinhalese kingdom until Kashyapa was defeated in A.D. 495. (Watch: An ancient palatial fortress overlooks this barren desert in Israel.)

After Kashyapa, dynasties rose and fell, their fortunes shaped by internal power struggles and conflicts between native Sinhalese and outside invaders from India.

        Nallur Temple
        Nallur Kandaswamy Kovil or Nallur Murugan Kovil is one of the most significant Hindu temples in the Jaffna District of Northern Province, Sri Lanka. The temple is a socially important institution for the Sri Lankan Tamils Hindu identity and many temples have been built in Europe and North America using the same name as a cultural memory. The presiding deity is Lord Muruga (son of Lord Siva a.k.a. Karthikeya) in the form of the holy Vel. The idol of the Nallur Devi or goddess was gifted to the temple in the 10 century AD by the Chola queen Sembiyan Mahadevi, in the style of Sembian bronzes.OriginThe Nallur Kandaswamy Temple’s foundation was laid in 948 AD on the land called “Kurukkal Valavu”. Due to invasion of foreigners, the temple had to be relocated several times in different places within Nallur area. It is believed that there was a shrine dedicated to an Islamic sufi saint in the temple complex from 1734 to 1749 which was relocated in 1749 when the temple structure was built. According to the Yalpana Vaipava Malai, the temple was developed at the site in the 13th century by Puvenaya Vaku, a Minister to the Jaffna King Kalinga Magha. Sapumal Kumaraya (also known as Chempaha Perumal in Tamil), the adopted son of King Bhuvanekabahu, the King of Kotte, is credited with either building or renovating the third Nallur Kandaswamy temple in the 15th century. Nallur served as the capital of the Jaffna kings, with the royal palace situated very close to the temple.The rebuilt temples that exist now do not match their original locations which instead are occupied by churches erected by the Portuguese. The temple which was at Sankili Thoppu was demolished by the Portuguese General Philip de Olivera in 1621. The Dutch took over the Jaffna District in 1658. A church was erected in the site at Sankili Thoppu where the temple stood.
